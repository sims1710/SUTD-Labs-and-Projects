Q1
In the real world, the exchange of keys can be performed using various methods, such as:

1. Secure Key Exchange Protocol (DHKE)
2. Physical Exchange (Printed document or USB)
3. Trusted Third Party (KDC)
4. Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

In general, it is desirable to have a secure channel for exchanging keys to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the exchanged information. Without a secure channel, there is a risk of interception, tampering, or impersonation by malicious actors.


Q2
Advantage: Key Exchange without Prior Communication - It allows parties to derive a shared secret key even if they have never interacted before, making it suitable for scenarios where pre-shared keys are not feasible.
Disadvantage: Lack of Authentication - There is a vulnerability to man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker intercepts the key exchange and impersonates one or both parties.


Q3
The key will be 2048 bits.
The decision to use a 2048-bit key size is a balance between security and performance. While larger key sizes offer stronger security, they also require more computational resources for key generation, encryption, and decryption operations. A 2048-bit key size is an industry standard in providing sufficient security while still being computationally feasible for most practical applications.
