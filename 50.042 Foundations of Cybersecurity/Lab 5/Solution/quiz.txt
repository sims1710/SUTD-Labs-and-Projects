1. False
There is a difference between addition and subtraction in GF(3) for certain elements. For example, 1 - 2 = 2 in GF(3) since the result wraps around to the positive range.

2. True
In GF(2N), addition and subtraction operations are equivalent for all elements. This is because GF(2N) uses binary arithmetic, where addition and subtraction are performed using the XOR operation.

3. True
In GF(2), multiplication is equivalent to an AND gate. This is because the coefficients in GF(2) are restricted to 0 and 1, where 1 represents true and multiplication corresponds to logical AND.

4. False
A polynomial of degree 8 is not a possible element of the field GF(2^8). In GF(2^8), the field elements are polynomials of degree less than 8 with coefficients in GF(2), meaning polynomials of degree 8 are not valid elements of the field.

5. False
P(x) = x^4 + x^3 + x + 1 is not an irreducible polynomial. It can be factored as (x^2 + x + 1)(x^2 + 1) over GF(2), indicating that it has nontrivial factors and is reducible.
